### **Ok Bracket Manager Description**
This is the senior capstone project of the team Ok Computer, the Ok Bracket Manager.

### **Vision Statement**

> "For tournament organizers who need to organize multiple brackets at a single event, the OK Bracket Manager is an application that will provide a single page to view and manage matches across all brackets at once. Unlike other bracket management applications, our product will unify multiple brackets into a single page, and have an understanding of what matches should happen based on the needs of the event as a whole."
